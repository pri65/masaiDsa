// one, two, three, four

// Perform the following operations on the four numbers

// The value stored in one and two is doubled, such that, if it was 2 initially, it becomes 4
// The value stored in three is multiplied by 3, such that, if it was 4, it becomes 12
// The value stored in four, is increased by 4, such that if it was 7 initially, it becomes 11
// Find the sum of the values stored inone, two, three, four, after the above operations are performed
