// Description

// Given an integer n, find out whether an integer is odd, even, or not skewed.

// An integer is oddly skewed if it has more number of odd divisors than even divisors and vice versa for evenly skewed.

// If the number of odd and even divisors are equal, then it is not skewed.

// Refer to the sample testcase for I/O.


// Input
// The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

// The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000000) — the number of shops in the neighborhood.


// Output
// For each test case, print the answer: "Odd Skewed" or "Even Skewed" or "Not Skewed".


// Sample Input 1 

// 3
// 4
// 6
// 11
// Sample Output 1

// Even Skewed
// Not Skewed
// Odd Skewed
