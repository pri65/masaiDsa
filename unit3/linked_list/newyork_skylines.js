// Description

// Gini and Johnny are on a trip to New York, and are in awe of the marvellous tall buildings of the city

// So, they decided to play a game

// They decided to give every building a rating, such that

// If the building is greater than the building to its left, and the building to its right, it gets 2 point

// If the building is greater than one of the buildings to it's left or the buildings to it right, it get's 1 point

// If the building is smaller than the building to it's left and the building to it's right, it gets 0 point

// Given an array, which gives the height of the buildings, find out the score of each building

// Note : You don't have to take the input
// Just complete the function and print the required function

// Input
// The first line of the input contains the valueT, the number of test cases

// For each test case, the first line contains the valueN, the number of buildings

// The next line contains the height of each building in the form ofNspace separated integers

// Constraints

// 1 <=T<= 10

// 2 <=N<= 10000

// 1 <=Height of building<= 1000


// Output
// For each test case, print the points scored by each of the buildings on a single line

// Sample Input 1 

// 2
// 5
// 1 4 3 2 7
// 2
// 1 3
// Sample Output 1

// 0 2 1 0 1 
// 0 1
